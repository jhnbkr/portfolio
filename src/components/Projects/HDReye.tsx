                HDReye is the first and only iOS app for creating custom 360Â°
                HDRi images for realistic 3D lighting and compositing. HDReye is
                an essential app for combining 3D animation realistically with
                footage or capturing lightmaps of any location.

                My role at HDReye oversees the design and development of
                infrastructure that powers our application. These include our
                stitching pipeline, asset management, payments, user management,
                authentication and more.
